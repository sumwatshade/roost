            The Coronavirus has crippled the economy in the United States
            within a matter of weeks. Small businesses (and the people they
            employ) have in particular suffered immediately. As a lovely
            and empathetic community, I am reaching out to my fellow
            San Diegans to help our neighbors in their time of need.

                <strong>Support local businesses</strong>: Although many shops
                have closed down their in-person experiences, we still have
                the opportunity to donate or purchase from them! Look for your
                favorite local business website and see if you can purchase a
                gift card or a piece of merchandise! We will work towards
                generating a list of venmo, patreon, paypal, or other methods
                by which the community can donate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Social Distancing</strong>: One of the best things for
                these businesses will be to reopen! Let&apos;s do our best to
                follow guidelines of social distancing and self-care in order
                to slow down the spread of disease. The better we do as a
                nation to mitigate the disease, the sooner these local
                businesses can open their doors to the public.
